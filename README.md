## How to install
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js and an npm package manager.

Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

- To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.
- To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.

### Install
Install Angular cli before using:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

Download the github project in a local folder and run (inside the projet folder):

    npm i

The npm command will download all necessary modules for the application

## How to use

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
